HW3: OpenStack Exercise
===============================================================================

Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Assignments must be completed individually.
* Discussion is allowed (e.g. via Slack) but the submission should be made by
  yourself. Acknowledge your helpers/collaborators name in the submission if
  you discussed or got help from anyone.
* Use an individual github repository. A repository in FutureSystems will be
  given later.


Create IU GitHub Account
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Simply login https://github.iu.edu with your IU Username and Password
  (It is a same IU Credential that you use on other IU sites e.g. one.iu.edu)

OpenStack Command Line Tool ``nova``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenStack Kilo is ready to use (as of 02/04/2016) on FutureSystems and you will
have a virtual instance (server) using OpenStack Command Line Tool ``nova``, if
you complete all the tasks in this assignment. The tasks you need to complete
are:

* SSH into india.futuresystems.org and
   * enable ``nova`` command
* Register a SSH key on OpenStack
   * ``rsa`` type
   * with default key file names 
      - public: ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``
      - private: ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa``
   * passphrase enabled
* Start a single instance:
   * on ``fg491`` project
   * with a ``m1.small`` flavor,
   * a ``Ubuntu-15.10-64`` image,
   * the registered key above,
   * and ``hw3-$OS_USERNAME`` vm name
   * Assign a Floating IP address
* Install required software on a virtual instance
   * virtualenv
   * pip
   * ansible

.. warning:: Do not terminate your instance, even if you completed and
        submitted hw3.

Test Program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide ``hw3.py`` test file in your repository. Run this on
india.futuresystems.org, if you completed all tasks above. All available tests
should be passed without errors. We use *virtualenv* to prepare packages.
Run::

        bash setup.sh
        source $HOME/bdossp_sp16/bin/activate

Now, we can run the test program::

        python hw3.py

Completed all? You may see::

        ...........
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ran 11 tests in 1.646s

        OK

Find ``hw3-results.txt`` file after you ran ``hw3.py`` python program in your
current directory. Add this file in your IU GitHub repository.

Submission via IU GitHub (github.iu.edu)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From now on, we will use IU GitHub to submit assignments on a private
repository. :ref:`IU GitHub Guidelines <ref-iu-github-for-assignments>`

1. Clone your private repository from the course organization.
   You IU Username is the name of your repository.

2. Create a ``hw3`` branch ::

   git branch hw3
   git checkout hw3

3. Run ``pull`` command to fetch and merge with the template repository::

   git pull git@github.iu.edu:bdossp-sp16/assignments.git hw3

4. Merge the template::

   git commit -am "initial merge with the template"

5. Add ``hw3-results.txt`` to your repository::

   git add hw3-results.txt

5. Commit your changes

6. Sync with remote::

   git push origin hw3

Challenging Tasks (Optional)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tasks are optional but strongly recommended to try. These are
related to **Python** packages and APIs (application program interface).
OpenStack ``nova`` is also extended to get more experience.

'Hello Big Data' Flask Web Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find a ``flask`` sub-directory in ``challange`` directory in your assignment
repository.  We provide ``hello.py`` python file and you can run the file in
your VM but there are a few requirements that we request::

   * Use virtualenv named 'bdossp-sp16' in your home directory
   * Open a web port to the Flask application to allow access from outside

.. note:: The two terms, VM or virtual instance, are exchangeable in this
        context.

1. What command(s) do you run to create and enable the virtualenv?
2. ``python hello.py`` may not work if you run only with standard python
   libraries. What command(s) do you run to resolve the issue? (hint. Flask is
   not a Python standard package)
3. If you ran the application successfully, you can see 'Hello Big Data'
   message on your web browser with the ``15000`` web port.  However, it is not
   accessible from outside e.g. http://IP_ADDRESS:15000.  It is because that
   there is no rule for the port in OpenStack Security Group. (We assume there
   is no firewall here). What ``nova`` command(s) do you need to create/add a
   security group for the port?
4. ``flask`` rule is provided in *fg491* project. What ``nova`` command(s) do
   you need to see current rule(s) in the security group and to apply it to
   your VM?

Write your solution in the name of ``flask-sol.txt`` text file after completing
the tasks above.

        Writing a script
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Find a `hw3-script` directory in your assignment repository. We provide a template
        bash script named ``hw3-
